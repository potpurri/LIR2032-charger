# LIR2032 Battery Charging Board

## Overview

Charging board for LIR2032 batteries (or other lithium type button/coin cell batteries with the same diameter and max voltage of 4.2V).

This project features a charging board for LIR2032 batteries. It uses a TP4056 to monitor charging and provides options for safety components. The circuit includes components to manage the charging process efficiently and safely.

**Note:** This project is a work in progress. The purpose is to have fun and learn more about these technologies.

## Features

The board includes the following components:

- **TP4056**: For monitoring the charging process.
- **Safety options**: Can use either a DW01A and a FS8205A or a XB7608AJ for safety.
- **P-MOSFETs**: Two P-MOSFETs cut the connection between the battery and the load during charging (if a load is connected to the charging board).
- **Schottky Diode**: Available to forward current from the USB-C charging input to the load during charging.
- **Charging Current Settings (Resistor R9)**: The resistor R9 is used to set the charging current with the following correlations:
